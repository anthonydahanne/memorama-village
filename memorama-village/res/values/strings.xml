    <string name="what_is_regalandroid">MemoramaVillage is a client to access the photos taken by the 4 cameras in Rue Sainte Catherine, Montreal, during the summer 2012\n
        This software is downloading the photos from http://www.memorama.me BUT is an un-official client of this website. ( I have no relationships whatsoever with Aires Libres, or the authors of Memorama.me)\n
        This software has been developed in the first place because http://www.memorama.me is not *easily* usable from a mobile phone, so I decided to create one client for Android.\n\n
